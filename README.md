# Flask ATM System

## Project Description
Flask ATM System is a web application built using Flask, where users can perform banking-like operations such as logging in with a PIN, checking balances, making deposits, withdrawing money, and changing their PIN. The app uses MongoDB to store user data, including PIN and transaction history, and features a simple, user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### Features:
- **Login & Registration**: Users can log in using a PIN or register a new account.
- **Transaction Options**: Users can check their balance, deposit, withdraw money, or change their PIN.
- **Flash Messages**: Feedback for successful and failed transactions.
- **Security**: PIN verification for each transaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Python web framework to build the web application.
